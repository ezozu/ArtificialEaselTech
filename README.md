# ArtificialEaselTech

## Description

A generative adversarial network (GAN) based NFT art platform leveraging PyTorch and OpenCV, utilizing style transfer and neural style transfer to create unique, AI-generated art pieces, with integrated Ethereum smart contract support for decentralized provenance and ownership verification.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for a software project about ArtificialEaselTech:
- "Utilizes generative adversarial networks to create realistic brushstroke simulations",
- "Supports realtime style transfer between images using convolutional neural networks",
- "Provides an extensible plugin architecture for integrating custom art tools and effects",
- "Includes a physicsbased painting engine with realistic color blending and texture mapping",
- "Offers a webbased collaborative canvas with realtime collaboration and version control",
- "Employs machine learningbased image segmentation for automatic object recognition and isolation",
- "Features a robust undo system with infinite history and customizable snapshot intervals"
- I hope these features meet your requirements! Let me know if you need any changes.
